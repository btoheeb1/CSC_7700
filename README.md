# CSC-7700
Custom MLP Engine for Classification & Regression

This repository contains a custom-built Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) engine implemented from scratch in Python and applied to two tasks:

MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

Vehicle MPG Prediction (Regression)

The project was developed to demonstrates the adaptability of neural networks by tackling both classification and regression with the same core engine.

📌 Project Overview

The MLP engine was built from the ground up using NumPy and Pandas, incorporating:

Custom activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, Softmax, Softplus, Mish, Linear)

Loss functions (Cross-Entropy, Mean Squared Error)

Regularization techniques: L2 penalty and dropout

Optimization strategies: Mini-batch training, Glorot weight initialization, RMSProp, and Early Stopping

The engine is modular, making it reusable for a variety of supervised learning tasks.
